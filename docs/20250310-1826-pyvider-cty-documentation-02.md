# What's Not Fully Implemented Yet

While `pyvider.cty` provides a solid foundation, there are several areas that are still under development or require refinement:

## Core System Gaps

### 1. Value Refinements
- **Incomplete Implementation**: The refinement system is partially implemented but not fully integrated.
- **Limited Constraints**: Only basic constraints (not-null, string prefix, number range) are supported.
- **Integration Issues**: Refinements don't fully propagate through operations and conversions.

### 2. Type Conversion System
- **Limited Built-in Conversions**: Only a subset of possible conversions are registered.
- **Collection Conversions**: Complex conversions between collection types need improvement.
- **Dynamic Type Handling**: Conversions to/from CtyDynamic need better support.

### 3. Path Navigation
- **Advanced Path Features**: No support for wildcards, filters, or pattern matching in paths.
- **Error Handling**: Path navigation errors need more detailed reporting.
- **Performance Optimization**: Path lookup isn't optimized for deep structures.

## Missing Functionality

### 4. Advanced Operations
- **Set Operations**: Union, intersection, and difference operations aren't implemented.
- **Map Operations**: Advanced map manipulation functions are missing.
- **Tuple Operations**: Limited support for tuple-specific operations.

### 5. Function System
- **Standard Library**: Many standard functions from Terraform's library are missing.
- **Function Cache**: No caching mechanism for expensive function calls.
- **Error Context**: Function errors need better context information.

### 6. Serialization
- **Complete Round-Trip**: Some complex types may have issues with round-trip serialization.
- **Schema Evolution**: No explicit support for schema evolution in serialized data.
- **Efficient Binary Format**: Lacks an optimized binary format for internal use.

## Integration Challenges

### 7. Schema System Integration
- **Schema Definition Language**: No DSL for schema definition with cty types.
- **Validation Pipeline**: Integration with a complete validation pipeline is incomplete.
- **Error Reporting**: Schema validation errors need more structure and context.

### 8. Terraform Compatibility
- **Data Model Alignment**: Some specific Terraform behaviors aren't fully replicated.
- **HCL Integration**: No direct integration with HCL parsing and evaluation.
- **Terraform Plugin Protocol**: Limited support for the full Terraform plugin protocol.

## Developer Experience

### 9. Error Handling
- **Error Hierarchy**: The error hierarchy needs expansion for more specific cases.
- **Contextual Errors**: Errors need more context (e.g., full paths in nested structures).
- **Recovery Strategies**: No built-in recovery strategies for common errors.

### 10. Documentation
- **Code Examples**: Limited examples for complex operations and patterns.
- **API Reference**: No comprehensive API reference documentation.
- **Migration Guide**: Missing guidance for users coming from Go's cty.

### 11. Performance Optimizations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Some operations create unnecessary intermediate objects.
- **Caching**: No strategic caching for repeated operations.
- **Large Data Handling**: No specific optimizations for very large data structures.

## Technical Debt

### 12. Testing Framework
- **Test Coverage**: Incomplete test coverage, especially for edge cases.
- **Property-Based Testing**: No property-based tests for type system invariants.
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Missing benchmarks for critical operations.

### 13. Type Extension System
- **Custom Type Registry**: No central registry for custom types.
- **Type Introspection**: Limited support for runtime type inspection.
- **Type Compatibility Rules**: Incomplete rules for determining type compatibility.

## Roadmap Areas

These areas are planned for future development:

1. **Comprehensive Function Library** matching Terraform's capabilities
2. **Advanced Schema Validation** with detailed error reporting
3. **Performance Optimizations** for large data structures
4. **Full Terraform Protocol Compatibility**
5. **Improved Developer Experience** with better documentation and examples
6. **Extended Type System** with user-defined types and constraints

If you're planning to use `pyvider.cty` in production, you should be aware of these limitations and plan your architecture accordingly. The core type system is functional, but these gaps might impact complex use cases.
