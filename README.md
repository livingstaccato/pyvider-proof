This is a chaotic mess, but at least it's proof that something real is happening hereâ€¦

A lot of this was written with different LLMs. So if you look at it and think, "WTF is going on? This is all kinds of wrong," my answer is probably gonbna be: "You're right. I'm writing the manual while figuring out the code, then cleaning it up and doing my best to do it properly."

Anyway, the goal here is to make configuring LLMs with Terraform easier a Trojan horse to lure the Hugging Face nerds into Infrastructure as Code using Terraaform instead of some other thing.

All code is all rights reserved by Tim Perkins as of 2025. This will change once I evaluate licensing strategies. Or whatever the legal phrasing should be.
