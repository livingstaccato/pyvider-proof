This is a chaotic mess, but at least it's proof that something real is happening here…

A lot of this was written with different LLMs. So if you look at it and think, “WTF is going on? This is all kinds of wrong,” then you’re absolutely right. I’m writing the manual as I figure out the code, then cleaning it up and doing my best to do it properly.

Anyway, my goal here is to make configuring LLMs with Terraform easier. And a Trojan horse to lure the Hugging Face nerds into IaC using Terraform instead of some other thing.

As Pyvider has matured, I’ve discovered that feeding my in-progress or newly generated code back into an LLM has exponentially sped up my ability to spin up new Terraform providers. Each iteration of the cycle—(1) generate code with LLM assistance, (2) refine it by hand, and (3) feed the refined code back to the LLM—produces more accurate, feature-complete outcomes and cuts my development time dramatically. This loop helps me scale both in terms of feature breadth and overall code quality, making it easier than ever to build specialized providers on top of Pyvider.
